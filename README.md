# AutoPkg Level-Up
If you're attending my session at the 2018 Mac Admins Conference at Penn State (or watching the recording of the session afterwards), you can follow along with the demos by ensuring you have the following apps installed on your Mac (you may want to run them once in advance to get rid of the Gatekeeper messages):

* [AutoPkgr](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/releases/latest) (Linde Group)
* [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/releases/latest) (Elliot Jordan)
* [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Bare Bones Software) or another text editor.

All the demo segments assume that you have downloaded and installed [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/releases/latest) (Neagle, Sutton, Olofsson, _et al_) and [git](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started#install-git), either from within AutoPkgr or on their own.

## Source Files
Here are the source recipes mentioned in the presentation:

* [ProVideoFormats recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/jazzace-recipes/tree/master/AppleProVideo) (Me)
* [TouchOSCEditor recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/jazzace-recipes/tree/master/Hexler) (Me)
* [Joshua Miller NVivo recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/joshua-d-miller-recipes/tree/master/NVivo)
* [William McGrath NVivo recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/nzmacgeek-recipes/tree/master/NVivo)

The files that were created/edited in the demo are shared in this repo — you may find it easier to read those files in a text editor or web browser than on the projector screen). My full AutoPkg recipe repo is [jazzace-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/jazzace-recipes).
