# AutoPkg Level-Up
If you're attending my session at the 2018 Mac Admins Conference at Penn State (or watching the recording of the session afterwards), you can follow along with the demos by ensuring you have the following apps installed on your Mac (you may want to run them once in advance to get rid of the Gatekeeper messages):

* [AutoPkgr](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr/releases/latest) (Linde Group)
* [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/releases/latest) (Elliot Jordan)
* [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Bare Bones Software)

In the demo, we will also download [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/releases/latest) (Neagle, Sutton, Olofsson, _et al_), [git](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started#install-git), and, optionally, [Munki](https://github.com/munki/munki/releases) (Walt Disney Animation Studios) from within AutoPkgr, but you can install those on their own if you prefer.
